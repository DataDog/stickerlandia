# Stickerlandia Implementation Tasks

Based on analysis of current codebase vs user stories. Organized by milestones with detailed tasks for Milestone 1 only.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Functional MVP
**Goal:** Stickerlandia runs on AWS serverless and docker-compose. Users can login, see stickers assigned to them, and browse all available stickers.

**Scope:**
Features:
- User authentication with local users
- Basic sticker collection viewing
- Sticker catalog browsing

Targets:
- docker-compose
- AWS serverless deployment

### Milestone 2: Production Deployment (Future)
**Goal:** Stickerlandia deployed to its forever home on AWS with full production infrastructure.

**Scope:**
Same as **Milestone 1**, with all the extra rigmarole required to get a permanent deployment going on - CI/CD setup,
proper Datadog integration, proper AWS account.
